# Conditioning of bipolar signal

In this tutorial we will do an electronic excourse. We want to acquire a +- 10V signal to use the full potential of the differential input.

The following steps must therefore be performed:

- Use a high impedance amplifier for defined input impedance with an attenuator (+-10V to +-1.6V)
- Add a positive voltage to the signal to remove the negative part (the ADC can only convert voltages >= 0V)
- Use the differential input to perform the reading



## Impedance converter with attenuator

Input stage for a defined input impedance of about 1 MOhm and attenuated output.



## Differential Amplifer or Umkehraddierer

Add a positive voltage (half of ADC Range) to the bipolar signal



## Differential Input
